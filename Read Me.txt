Developed in 2009.

This application is used to convert braille(language of blind) to text. This is done as a part of our mini-project during 3rd year 2nd semester (2009). I along with Laxmi Narayana and Vijaya Saradi worked on it.

How to use this application?

1. Before you run the application for the first time,
Place the braille.ttf in "C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\lib\fonts" or a similar path specific to your system.

2. Run application by using the start.bat.

3. In order to see what you type, change the mode to text to braille. Goto Action -> text to braille or use shift + T.
